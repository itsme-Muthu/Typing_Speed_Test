# Typing_Speed_Test

The Typing Test application is a web-based tool designed to enhance users' typing skills through engaging and interactive typing exercises. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application allows users to practice typing accuracy and speed in a user-friendly environment. Users can type predefined paragraphs while the application tracks their performance, displaying metrics such as raw typing speed, accuracy, words per minute (WPM), and characters per minute (CPM), along with the number of mistakes made during the test.

Additionally, the application provides a result verdict after each test, summarizing the user's performance and highlighting areas for improvement. The backend server, built with Node.js and Express, connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve users' highest WPM scores. With an intuitive interface featuring real-time feedback and the ability to restart tests, the Typing Test application aims to provide an effective platform for individuals looking to improve their typing efficiency and overall keyboard skills.
